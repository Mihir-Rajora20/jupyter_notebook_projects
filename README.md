# jupyter_notebook_projects
My  Data Science and Machine Learning Projects containing data visualisations, movie recommender systems and many more projects 
I have undertaken. 

The projects include a basic overview of usage of machine learning and data visualisation libraries like 
Seaborn
Numpy
Matplotlib
NLTK

I have taken some popular datasets from Kaggle or other datasets to process data.
